## MERN Book Search Engine 


Our task was to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

## Criteria

Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

Deploy the application to Heroku.

## Installation

To install this app you can open it in VS Code, and run the command: npm start. This will take yu to the apollo site. Also, you can run: npm run build to see the app working. 

Alternatively, the app is deployed to gitHub pages at:



You can also find it deployed to heroku at:
